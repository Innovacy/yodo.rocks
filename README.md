Yodo stands for: You Only Develop Once - a rapid development framework

Behind Yodo stands the idea, that everything should developed only once and reused in every other application or website where it would be needed again.

Too often, this is not the case, as Frameworks or the projects build are just not modular enough.

The goal with Yodo is to change that, as the Yodo architecture itself should make enforce that modularity as much as possible by default, even if the developer doesn't pay much attention.

With most other frameworks we tend to build massive standalone apps, which makes it difficult to reuse or even combine them.


Why Yodo Rocks?
--------

Now you could think, Yodo rocks or not, but when I'm talking about Yodo rocks, I'm talking about Yodo's architecture.

'Rocks' are the main concept behind Yodo. Rocks are the modular parts that can be combined as needed and make up a complete app. However, unlike the concept of modules which have a lot of dependencies usually, rocks are fully functional apps on their own and yet as flexible to work together.

Further, with the concept of rocks, Yodo wants to make rapid web development possible.

Another goal of Yodo is, to allow development without bothering too much about any internals. Make writing code feel as natural as possible and less technical. This comes with the benefit of being developed from the beginning to be as flexible, to support any technologies by not fully depending on any technology. In practice, this means, if a developer wants to use Smarty and another Twig as template engine for their Rock, they can do so, however the one writing the business logic wouldn't need to even know which template engine is used to make things work.


Roadmap
--------

Yodo has a long way still before it will implement everything for the 1.0.0 release.

There's no roadmap yet, as it's in the early stages. For now it's just about getting as much code done for a first functional release. Then, when the time seems right, a roadmap will be announced.

You are welcomed to participate with ideas, suggest improvements or even contribute.
